# scripts
**make_pinched_info_snewpy.ipynb**: script to re-bin SNEWPY supernova model parameters (luminosity, average energy, pinching parameter) into linear bins and create a formatted file for use with SNOwGLoBES  

**makeflux.C**: ROOT macro to re-bin general supernova model parameters (luminosity, average energy, pinching parameter) into linear bins and create a formatted file for use with SNOwGLoBES  

**plotFitParams.C**: ROOT macro to plot superimposed ROC curves for a directory of detection results as well as plot superimposed probability density distributions of best-fit SASI frequency, relative amplitude, start time, and time duration across shot-noised neutrino number flux event rates  

**sasimeterruns_tstart_tdur_v4.C**: ROOT macro to produce estimated probability density distributions of log-likehood ratios maximized with respect to SASI oscillation parameters by analyzing shot-noised event rates from supernova models with and without SASI activity.

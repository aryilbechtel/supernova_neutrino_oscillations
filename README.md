Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) could play an important role in the reignition of the shock wave of a core collapse supernova, a poorly understood process that leads to the expulsion of the star’s outer shell. The presence of SASI is expected to cause time-dependent oscillations in neutrino number flux. In this study, we examined the prospects of observing SASI in the Hyper-Kamiokande, Super- Kamiokande, JUNO, and DUNE detectors. We used SNoWGLoBES software and a 3D simluation of a 27 M⊙ progenitor to estimate what we might measure. A likelihood ratio in the frequency domain, maximized with respect to SASI amplitude, frequency, start time, and duration was used as a SASI detection indicator for neutrino fluxes at different distances and viewing directions. Below are ROC curves showing the ability of the likelihood ratio to identify oscillations in event rates detected with the four detectors at various distances.
